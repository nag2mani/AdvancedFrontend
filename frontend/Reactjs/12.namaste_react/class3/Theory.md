### 1. **Is JSX mandatory for React?**  
No, JSX (JavaScript XML) is not mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended because it makes the UI code more readable and maintainable. React can work without JSX using plain JavaScript by using `React.createElement()`. However, JSX simplifies the process of writing components and enhances code readability.  

For example:  
Without JSX:
```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', { className: 'title' }, 'Hello, World!');
```
With JSX:
```jsx
const element = <h1 className="title">Hello, World!</h1>;
```
JSX gets transpiled to `React.createElement()` calls using Babel before rendering.

### 2. **Is ES6 mandatory for React?**  
No, ES6 is not mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended because many modern React features rely on ES6+ syntax. Features like arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, and spread/rest operators make React development more efficient.  

Example of ES5:
```js
var HelloComponent = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
  }
});
```
Example of ES6:
```jsx
class HelloComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}
```
React officially moved away from `React.createClass()` to ES6 classes and function components.

### 3. **`{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in JSX**  

- `{TitleComponent}`: This is used when `TitleComponent` is a **variable** storing a React component or function. It does not render the component directly.  

  Example:
  ```jsx
  const TitleComponent = () => <h1>Title</h1>;
  <div>{TitleComponent}</div> // Incorrect - will not render "Title"
  ```

- `{<TitleComponent/>}`: This syntax **instantiates and renders** the component as a self-closing tag.  

  Example:
  ```jsx
  <div>{<TitleComponent />}</div> // Correct - renders "Title"
  ```

- `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`: This is an alternative way to instantiate a component, useful when passing children to it.  

  Example:
  ```jsx
  <TitleComponent>Subtitle</TitleComponent>
  ```

Both `<TitleComponent/>` and `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` are valid, but the former is preferred for stateless components.

---

### 4. **How can I write comments in JSX?**  
In JSX, comments should be written inside `{}` using `/* */`.

Example:
```jsx
return (
  <div>
    {/* This is a JSX comment */}
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </div>
);
```
HTML-style comments (`<!-- -->`) won't work inside JSX.

---

### 5. **What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?**  
`<React.Fragment>` and its shorthand `<></>` are used to group multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes.

Example:
```jsx
return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </React.Fragment>
);
```
OR using shorthand:
```jsx
return (
  <>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </>
);
```
This helps avoid unnecessary div wrappers in the DOM.

### 6. **What is Virtual DOM?**  
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses it to update the UI efficiently.

- When the state changes, React creates a new VDOM tree.
- It compares the new VDOM with the previous one (Diffing).
- React updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM (Reconciliation).

This process improves performance because modifying the real DOM is expensive.

---

### 7. **What is Reconciliation in React?**  
Reconciliation is React’s algorithm to update the DOM efficiently. It involves:

1. Comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (Diffing).
2. Determining the minimal number of changes required.
3. Updating only the necessary parts in the real DOM.

React uses a **heuristic diffing algorithm** where:
- Components of different types result in a full re-render.
- Lists use **keys** to optimize updates.

---

### 8. **What is React Fiber?**  
React Fiber is the **new reconciliation engine** introduced in React 16 to improve rendering performance. Key benefits:

- **Concurrency:** Allows rendering to be paused and resumed.
- **Prioritization:** High-priority updates (like user input) are processed before low-priority ones (like animations).
- **Better UI responsiveness:** Prevents UI from freezing.

React Fiber makes animations, gestures, and large UI updates smoother.

---

### 9. **Why do we need keys in React? When do we need keys?**  
Keys help React identify elements uniquely, improving list rendering performance. React uses keys to track changes in components efficiently.

- **Needed in lists**:
  ```jsx
  items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)
  ```
- **Without keys**, React may incorrectly reuse elements, leading to UI bugs.
- **Keys are required when elements are dynamically generated or reordered**.

---

### 10. **Can we use index as keys in React?**  
Yes, but it's not recommended unless items are static.

Example:
```jsx
items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item.name}</li>)
```
**Why avoid index keys?**
- When items change order or are removed, React might mismatch elements, leading to rendering issues.
- Prefer using **unique IDs** instead.

---

### 11. **What are props in React?**  
Props (short for **properties**) are immutable data passed from a parent component to a child component.

Example:
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

<Greeting name="Alice" />
```
Ways to use props:
1. **Passing strings**: `<Component name="value" />`
2. **Passing numbers/booleans**: `<Component count={5} isLoggedIn={true} />`
3. **Passing functions**: `<Component onClick={handleClick} />`
4. **Destructuring props**:
   ```jsx
   function Greeting({ name }) {
     return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
   }
   ```

### 12. **What is a Config Driven UI?**  
A **Config Driven UI** is a UI architecture where components are dynamically generated based on external configuration data, instead of hardcoded layouts.

Example:
- Instead of:
  ```jsx
  <button>Click Me</button>
  ```
- Use:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "button",
    "label": "Click Me",
    "style": { "color": "blue" }
  }
  ```
- Render dynamically:
  ```jsx
  function DynamicComponent({ config }) {
    if (config.type === "button") {
      return <button style={config.style}>{config.label}</button>;
    }
  }
  ```

### **Benefits of Config Driven UI:**
- **Flexibility**: UI updates don’t require code changes.
- **Reusability**: The same logic can render multiple UIs.
- **API-driven**: UI can be generated from a backend.

It is commonly used in **dashboard builders, CMS, and admin panels**.
