The difference between **React** and **ReactDOM** lies in their **responsibilities**:

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **React** | Provides the core library for building user interfaces (components, state, props, hooks, etc.) |
| **ReactDOM** | Handles the rendering of React components to the **DOM** (specifically for web browsers) |

---

## ‚úÖ **1. React**
- The **core library** used for defining components and managing state.  
- Provides the fundamental building blocks like **components**, **hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`), and the **JSX syntax**.  
- React itself is **platform-agnostic** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt know or care whether it‚Äôs rendering to a web browser, mobile app (React Native), or other targets.  

### Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```
‚û°Ô∏è Here, `React` is responsible for creating the component and managing the state.

---

## ‚úÖ **2. ReactDOM**
- Provides methods to **interact with the DOM** (specific to web browsers).  
- Takes the virtual DOM generated by React and renders it into the actual DOM.  
- Includes functions like:
  - `ReactDOM.createRoot()` ‚Äì Creates a root for rendering components.  
  - `ReactDOM.render()` ‚Äì Renders the component tree into the DOM (used before React 18).  

### Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```
‚û°Ô∏è Here, `ReactDOM` is responsible for attaching the `App` component to the actual DOM element (`#root`).

## üöÄ **Key Differences**
| Aspect | React | ReactDOM |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Core library for building UI components | Renders components to the actual DOM |
| **Platform** | Platform-agnostic (can be used for web, mobile, desktop) | Specific to web browsers |
| **Functionality** | Manages state, lifecycle, props, hooks | Mounts, updates, and unmounts components in the DOM |
| **Example** | `React.Component`, `useState`, `useEffect` | `ReactDOM.createRoot`, `ReactDOM.render` |

---

## üí° **Why Separate Them?**
- React is designed to be **platform-independent**.  
- By separating React and ReactDOM, React can be used for **React Native** (mobile), **React Three Fiber** (3D), and other platforms ‚Äî while ReactDOM remains specific to web development.  

---

### üî• **In Short:**  
- **React** = Defines and manages the logic of the components.  
- **ReactDOM** = Renders those components into the browser DOM.
