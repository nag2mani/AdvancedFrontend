    The `crossorigin` attribute in the `<script>` tag is used to handle **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** when loading resources from a different origin (in this case, from the `unpkg.com` CDN).

### Why `crossorigin` is needed:
1. **React uses source maps for debugging** –  
   When you load React from a CDN, the browser may try to download the source maps (for better debugging).  
   - Source maps are often hosted on a different origin than your site.  
   - Without the `crossorigin` attribute, the browser will block loading these source maps due to **CORS restrictions**.  

2. **Without `crossorigin`, errors from external scripts are not detailed** –  
   - If an external script throws an error, the browser will report it as `"Script error."` instead of showing the actual error message and stack trace.  
   - Setting `crossorigin` allows the browser to give a detailed error message.  

### How `crossorigin` Works:
- `crossorigin` can take three possible values:
  - `anonymous` (default) – The browser sends no credentials (like cookies) and expects the server to have proper CORS headers.
  - `use-credentials` – The browser sends credentials (like cookies) and requires the server to allow credentials in CORS headers.
  - If omitted – No CORS checks are performed, and errors from cross-origin scripts are masked.  

### Example in context:
In this case:
```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
```
- `crossorigin` is set to `anonymous` (since it's the default).  
- The browser expects the CDN (`unpkg.com`) to send proper CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) for the script and any related source maps.  
- This ensures that debugging information (like stack traces) is available, and source maps can be loaded without CORS issues.

### ✅ Best Practice:
- When using third-party CDNs (like `unpkg`, `jsdelivr`, or `cdnjs`) for scripts that support source maps, **adding `crossorigin="anonymous"`** ensures you can debug scripts properly and avoid CORS-related issues.
