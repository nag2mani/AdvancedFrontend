In HTML, the `async` and `defer` attributes are used with the `<script>` tag to control how JavaScript files are loaded and executed in relation to the HTML parsing process.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. `async`**
- The `async` attribute tells the browser to:  
   ‚úîÔ∏è Download the script **asynchronously** (in the background) while the HTML document is being parsed.  
   ‚úîÔ∏è Once downloaded, the script is executed **immediately**, even if HTML parsing is not yet finished.  

### **Example**:
```html
<script src="script.js" async></script>
```

### **How it Works**:
1. HTML parsing starts.  
2. The script starts downloading in parallel with HTML parsing.  
3. As soon as the script is downloaded, HTML parsing **pauses** to execute the script.  
4. HTML parsing resumes after the script finishes execution.  

### ‚úÖ **Best Use Case**:
- Suitable for scripts that **don't depend on other scripts** or **DOM elements** (like tracking scripts, analytics, ads).  

---

## ‚úÖ **2. `defer`**
- The `defer` attribute tells the browser to:  
   ‚úîÔ∏è Download the script **asynchronously** (in the background) while HTML parsing continues.  
   ‚úîÔ∏è Execute the script **only after** the HTML document has been fully parsed.  

### **Example**:
```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

### **How it Works**:
1. HTML parsing starts.  
2. The script starts downloading in parallel with HTML parsing.  
3. HTML parsing **continues** without interruption.  
4. After the HTML document is fully parsed, the script executes **in the order they appear** in the document.  

### ‚úÖ **Best Use Case**:
- Suitable for scripts that **depend on the DOM** or other scripts (like UI scripts).  
- Ensures scripts execute in the correct order.

## üöÄ **Key Differences**
| Attribute | Downloading | Execution | Order |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **async** | Parallel with HTML parsing | As soon as it's downloaded (interrupts parsing) | No guaranteed order |
| **defer** | Parallel with HTML parsing | After HTML parsing completes | Executes in order of appearance |

## üí° **Example Comparison**
### 1. Without `async` or `defer`:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
‚û°Ô∏è HTML parsing **pauses** until the script is downloaded and executed.

### 2. With `async`:
```html
<script src="script1.js" async></script>
<script src="script2.js" async></script>
```
‚û°Ô∏è Scripts will download and execute **as soon as available** ‚Äî **no guaranteed order**.

### 3. With `defer`:
```html
<script src="script1.js" defer></script>
<script src="script2.js" defer></script>
```
‚û°Ô∏è Scripts will download in parallel and execute **in the order they appear** after HTML parsing is finished.

## üî• **In Short:**  
- Use **`async`** for independent scripts (like Google Analytics).  
- Use **`defer`** for scripts that rely on DOM elements or other scripts (like UI or framework code).
