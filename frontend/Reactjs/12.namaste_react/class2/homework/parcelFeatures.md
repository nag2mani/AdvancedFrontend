Features of Parcel;

- **Created A Server**: Parcel comes with a built-in development server that automatically reloads changes, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.  
- **HMR - Hot Module Reloading**: Parcel supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), allowing changes in code to be reflected instantly in the browser without a full page reload.  
- **File Watcher Algorithm - C++**: Parcel uses a highly efficient file-watching algorithm written in C++ to track and update changes in the project instantly.  
- **BUNDLING**: It automatically bundles JavaScript, CSS, and assets efficiently with minimal configuration, optimizing files for production.  
- **MINIFY**: Parcel minifies JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to reduce file sizes and improve loading speed.  
- **Cleaning Our Code**: It removes unused code (tree shaking) and optimizes imports to keep the final bundle clean.  
- **Dev and Production Build**: Parcel differentiates between development and production builds, applying optimizations like minification and caching only in production.  
- **Super Fast Build Algorithm**: Using parallel processing and caching, Parcel significantly speeds up the bundling process.  
- **Image Optimization**: Parcel optimizes images by compressing and converting them to efficient formats like WebP.  
- **Caching While Development**: It caches previously built files, reducing rebuild times and improving performance.  
- **Compression**: Parcel applies Gzip and Brotli compression to reduce the size of assets for faster loading.  
- **Compatible with Older Versions of Browser**: Using `browserslist`, Parcel ensures compatibility with older browsers by transpiling modern JavaScript features.  
- **HTTPS on Dev**: It allows serving the development server over HTTPS for secure local development.  
- **Port Number**: Parcel automatically assigns a port for the dev server but allows customization via CLI options.  
- **Consistent Hashing Algorithm**: It uses a hashing mechanism to generate unique filenames for assets, preventing cache issues.  
- **Zero Config**: One of Parcel's main advantages is its zero-configuration setup, allowing developers to get started without manual setup.
